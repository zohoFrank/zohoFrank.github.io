## About Project
This is the entrance/home page for my site.

### Basic info.
* **React+Redux** for quick and modular development. Making the project more structured and easily maintained.
> Although this page is a light-weight project, just adopt React+Redux for consistence with other pages on this site and for convenience of further developing.

* **LESS** for more structured CSS styles.
> All LESS files and static resources (image, font, etc.) are loaded by Webpack.

* **ES6+Webpack** for modular development and loading static resources.
* **npm** for global package management.
### Quick Start
Basically, you start a webdev-server and a webpack watching process. It creates a source-mapping for all files.
``` bash
npm run dev
```
Furthermore, if you don't like source mapping, or in **distribution** circumstances, so you **only** need to bundle all the modules.
``` bash
npm run dist
```
